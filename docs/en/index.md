# Subsites

The SilverStripe subsites module allows you to manage multiple related sites through a single CMS interface. Because
all sites run on a single installation of SilverStripe, they can share users, content and assets. They can all use the
same templates, or each use different ones.

This document assumes that you have full admin rights for your site.
