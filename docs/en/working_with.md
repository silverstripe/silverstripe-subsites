## Subsites virtual pages

You can pull in the content from a page that resides on another subsite by creating a page of the type **Subsites
Virtual Page**. Pick the subsite from which you want to pull the content, then select the page. As with regular virtual
pages, your **Subsites Virtual Page** will display the content from the original page and get updated automatically if
the original content changes.
