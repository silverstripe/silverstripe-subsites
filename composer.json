	"description": "The subsites module allows multiple websites to run from a single
		installation of SilverStripe, and share users, content, and assets between them.
		A useful way to think of its use is where you have a business with a global
		headquarters and four branches in various countries. The subsites module allows
		the five offices to use a single SilverStripe installation, and have information
		from the headquarters flow down into the branches. The branches can have separate
		users/admins, and information that is individual. The website templates can also
		be different.",
